# Icon Placeholders

This extension needs the following icon files:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

The icons should represent the Hebrew learning theme - perhaps incorporating:
- Hebrew letters (אבג)
- Books or learning symbols
- Language/translation iconography
- Blue/purple color scheme to match the UI

For now, you can create simple placeholder icons or use existing ones from icon libraries.
